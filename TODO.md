* [X] Create a Three.js application for a rural landscape scene with an alien spaceship
* [X] Generate procedural textures for a floral field and a terrain
* [X] Model a typically Alentejano house using geometric primitives (cubes, cylinders, etc.) and polygon meshes
* [X] Model a tree using geometric primitives and polygon meshes
* [X] Model an Alentejano montado landscape using geometric primitives and polygon meshes
* [X] Apply textures to all scene objects that react to lighting
* [X] Implement a UFO orbiting the scene with:
  * [X] A flattened sphere for the UFO body
  * [X] A spherical cap for the cockpit
  * [X] Multiple small spheres radially placed at the bottom
  * [X] A flattened cylinder at the center of the bottom
  * [X] Point lights anchored to each small sphere, toggled with 'P' or 'p'
  * [X] Spotlight anchored to the cylinder, pointing downward, toggled with 'S' or 's'
  * [X] Constant angular rotation around its symmetry axis
  * [X] Horizontal movement controlled by arrow keys (up, down, left, right), supporting simultaneous key presses
* [X] Define three material types for each scene object:
  * [X] MeshLambertMaterial (Gouraud shading), toggled with 'Q' or 'q'
  * [X] MeshPhongMaterial (Phong shading), toggled with 'W' or 'w'
  * [X] MeshToonMaterial (Cartoon shading), toggled with 'E' or 'e'
  * [X] Toggle lighting calculations with 'R' or 'r'
* [X] Implement a fixed perspective camera with a view of the entire scene, selectable with '7'
* [X] Add a THREE.StereoCamera for VR support, following Three.js VR documentation
* [X] Handle window resize events appropriately
